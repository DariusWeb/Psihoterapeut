	"about": {
		"intro": "I am Andreea Butacu, a clinical psychologist, on a continuous journey exploring how well-being can be understood, experienced, and cultivated — both in my own experience and in the lives of those around me.",
		"experience": {
			"title": "My Experience",
			"corporate": "Initially, I discovered the opportunity to contribute to well-being from an organizational perspective, managing various roles in human resources. As a recruiter, I supported people in finding their right place; as a learning and development (L&D) specialist, I facilitated access to relevant professional growth tools; and as an L&D trainer and manager, I supported teams in their evolution and adaptation process.",
			"academic": "Life experiences and personal challenges led me to a deeper exploration of the concept of well-being — in its individual, emotional, and relational dimensions. Studies at the Faculty of Psychology provided me with answers, but also essential questions that encouraged me to continue. I completed a Master's in Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy and, subsequently, extensive training in Integrative Psychotherapy at the Romanian Institute of Integrative Psychotherapy.",
			"research": "This inner and professional quest also led me to the academic space, participating in the development of a chapter in the Treatise on Psychology of Happiness, a valuable contribution to the field's specialized literature."
		},
		"commitment": {
			"title": "My Commitment",
			"mission": "My mission is to support people in the process of reconnecting with themselves, facilitating emotional exploration and discovering the inner resources necessary for cultivating authentic and sustainable well-being. I aim to create a safe, empathetic, and non-judgmental space where each person feels understood, supported, and encouraged to build their personal balance in accordance with their own values and needs.",
			"invitation": "If you feel it's time to approach yourself with more gentleness, to understand your emotions, or to regain your inner balance, I openly invite you to go through this process together. Well-being is a personal journey, but you don't have to walk it alone."
